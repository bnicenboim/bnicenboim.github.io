# About me

I'm an assistant professor at the department of [Department of Computational Cognitive Science, Cognitive Science and AI, of Tilburg University](https://research.tilburguniversity.edu/en/persons/bruno-nicenboim), PI of the [Computational Psycholinguistics Lab](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/about/schools/tshd/departments/dca/lab/computational-psycholinguistics). Before that I did my PhD and Postdoc in [Shravan Vasishth's lab](http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/~vasishth/), at the Department of Linguistics of University of Potsdam, Germany.

# My Main Interests

## Computational Cognitive Modeling

I study computational cognitive modeling of psycholinguistic phenomena, with some examples below:

-   Nicenboim, B. (2023). "The CoFI Reader: A Continuous Flow of Information approach to modeling reading." In: MathPsych/ICCM/EMPG. University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. [\[read\]](https://mathpsych.org/presentation/998#/document)

-   Nicenboim, B. and S. Vasishth (2018). "Models of Retrieval in Sentence Comprehension: A computational evaluation using Bayesian hierarchical modeling." In: *Journal of Memory and Language*, 99, pp. 1–34. ISSN: 0749-596X. DOI: 10.1016/j.jml.2017.08.004. [\[read\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.04174)

I am also interested in broader aspects of computational modeling:

-   Dubova, M., S. Chandramouli, G. Gigerenzer, P. Grünwald, W. Holmes, T. Lombrozo, M. Marelli, S. Musslick, **B. Nicenboim**, L. N. Ross, et al. (2025). "Is Ockham's razor losing its edge? New perspectives on the principle of model parsimony." In: *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, 122(5), p. e2401230121. DOI: 10.1073/pnas.2401230121. [\[read\]](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2401230121)

-   I organized the Lorentz Centre "Cognitive Modeling of Complex Behavior" workshop in January 2024, along with [Riccardo Fusaroli](https://fusaroli.weebly.com) and [Marieke van Vugt](https://mkvanvugt.wordpress.com/). This hands-on event focused on collaborative modeling of cognitive phenomena. See [here](https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/cognitive-modeling-of-complex-behavior.html).

-   I served as the local chair of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Society for Mathematical Psychology (MathPsych) and the 22nd International Conference on Cognitive Modeling (ICCM) 2024. [(conference link)](https://mathpsych.org/conference/15/).

## EEG in Psycholinguistics

I also work with EEG in psycholinguistics:

-   I'm currently finishing a project focusing on self-paced EEG data for benchmarks and computational modeling in the context of an [NWO Open Competition SGW XS grant](https://www.nwo.nl/en/researchprogrammes/open-competition-ssh/granted-projects).

-   K. Stone, B. Nicenboim, S. Vasishth, et al. "Understanding the effects of constraint and predictability in ERP." In: *Neurobiology of Language* (Dec. 2022), pp. 1-71. DOI: 10.1162/nol_a_00094. [\[read\]](https://direct.mit.edu/nol/article-pdf/doi/10.1162/nol/_a/_00094/2062866/nol/_a/_00094.pdf)

-   B. Nicenboim, S. Vasishth, and F. Rösler. "Are words pre-activated probabilistically during sentence comprehension? Evidence from new data and a Bayesian random-effects meta-analysis using publicly available data." In: *Neuropsychologia*, 142 (2020), p. 107427. DOI: 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2020.107427. [\[read\]](https://psyarxiv.com/2atrh/)

I also developed an R package for EEG data manipulation: [eeguana](https://bnicenboim.github.io/eeguana/).

## Bayesian Statistics

Bayesian statistics provides a powerful framework for cognitive science by allowing principled uncertainty quantification and hierarchical modeling. I mostly work with Stan (and brms):

-   [Introduction to Bayesian Data Analysis for Cognitive Science](https://bruno.nicenboim.me/bayescogsci) , co-authored with [Shravan Vasishth](http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/~vasishth/) and [Daniel Schad](https://danielschad.github.io/). You can [[buy it]](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.1201/9780429342646/introduction-bayesian-data-analysis-cognitive-science-shravan-vasishth-bruno-nicenboim-daniel-schad) or [[read it for free]](https://bruno.nicenboim.me/bayescogsci).

-   [Stan for Cognitive Science](https://cognitive-science-stan.github.io/): A resource hub for Bayesian modeling with Stan.

## Data and Code

Most of the data and code from my published papers are available on the [OSF website](https://osf.io/cmist/), with some exceptions in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bnicenboim).

<!-- And I'm also contributing to the [list of publicly available psycholinguistics datasets](https://github.com/tmalsburg/PsychlingDatasets/wiki/A-directory-of-publicly-available-data-sets-from-psycholinguistic-studies).  -->
