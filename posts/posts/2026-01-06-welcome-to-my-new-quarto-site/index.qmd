## A fresh start

After years of using Hugo, I've finally made the switch to [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).

The main reason? Hugo wasn't allowing me to update my website anymore!

The old posts from my Hugo site are gone (for now), but I'm looking forward to building up new content here. Stay tuned!
