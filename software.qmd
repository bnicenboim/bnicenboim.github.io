An R package for estimating the log-probabilities of words in a given context using transformer models. The package provides an interface for utilizing pre-trained transformer models (such as GPT-2 or BERT) to obtain word probabilities. These log-probabilities are often utilized as predictors in psycholinguistic studies.
