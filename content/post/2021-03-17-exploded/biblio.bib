  abstract = {A Thurstonian model for ranking data assumes that observed rankings are consistent with those of a set of underlying continuous variables. This model is appealing since it renders ranking data amenable to familiar models for continuous response variablesâ€”namely, linear regression models. To date, however, the use of Thurstonian models for ranking data has been very rare in practice. One reason for this may be that inferences based on these models require specialized technical methods. These methods have been developed to address computational challenges involved in these models but are not easy to implement without considerable technical expertise and are not widely available in software packages. To address this limitation, we show that Bayesian Thurstonian models for ranking data can be very easily implemented with the JAGS software package. We provide JAGS model files for Thurstonian ranking models for general use, discuss their implementation, and illustrate their use in analyses.},

abstract = {An ordered logit specification for use on ranked individual data is used to analyze survey data on potential consumer demand for electric cars. In many situations in economics and marketing we would like to be able to forecast consumer demands for goods which have not yet appeared in actual markets. By defining goods as a bundle of underlying attributes, we can use discrete choice models to estimate consumer evaluations. Then new good demand is forecast by use of the estimated coefficients to compare consumer evaluation of the new good to existing choices. When ranked individual data are available, we can estimate separate coefficients for each individual rather than assuming identical coefficients as is usual with logit models. Our results indicate considerable dispersion in individual coefficients. This finding can have important implications for new product analysis.}
