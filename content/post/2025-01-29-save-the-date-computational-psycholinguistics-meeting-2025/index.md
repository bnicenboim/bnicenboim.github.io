We are excited to announce the launch of a new recurring meeting dedicated exclusively to computational psycholinguistics. The first Computational Psycholinguistics Meeting 2025 will take place in Utrecht, the Netherlands, on December 18–19, 2025.

This meeting provides a dedicated space for researchers working with (neuro-)symbolic, Bayesian, deep-learning, connectionist, and mechanistic models like ACT-R to discuss how these approaches explain and predict human language production, perception, and processing.

### Keynote Speakers

Stefan Frank (Radboud University) – [Website](http://stefanfrank.info/)

Vera Demberg (Saarland University) – [Website](https://www.uni-saarland.de/lehrstuhl/demberg/members/verademberg.html)

### Topics (not exhaustive)

- How (neuro-)symbolic, Bayesian, deep-learning, connectionist, and  mechanistic models (e.g., ACT-R) explain and predict human language processing.
- Strengths and limitations of different modeling approaches.
- Integrating linguistic information across words, sentences, and discourse for comprehension and production.
- Computational, algorithmic, and implementational analyses of psycholinguistic phenomena.
- Advances in modeling semantics, syntax, sentence processing, speech perception, and production.
 
More details, including the call for abstracts, will be available soon. For updates, visit: https://cpl2025.sites.uu.nl/
