We are excited to announce the first Computational Psycholinguistics Meeting 2025, which will take place in Utrecht, the Netherlands, on December 18–19, 2025.

This meeting provides a dedicated space for researchers working with (neuro-)symbolic, Bayesian, deep-learning, connectionist, and mechanistic models like ACT-R to discuss how these approaches explain and predict human language production, perception, and processing.

**The abstract submission deadline has been extended to June 29, 2025 (anywhere on Earth).**  
Submit your abstract via [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=UU.nl/Utrecht_University/2025/CPL)

### Keynote Speakers

[Stefan Frank (Radboud University)](http://stefanfrank.info/)  
[Vera Demberg (Saarland University)](https://www.uni-saarland.de/lehrstuhl/demberg/members/verademberg.html)

### Topics (not exhaustive)

- How (neuro-)symbolic, Bayesian, deep-learning, connectionist, and mechanistic models (e.g., ACT-R) explain and predict human language processing.
- Strengths and limitations of different modeling approaches.
- Integrating linguistic information across words, sentences, and discourse for comprehension and production.
- Computational, algorithmic, and implementational analyses of psycholinguistic phenomena.
- Advances in modeling semantics, syntax, sentence processing, speech perception, and production.
