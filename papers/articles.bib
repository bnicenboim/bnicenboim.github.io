    abstract = {Cognitive functioning is increasingly considered when making treatment decisions for patients with a glioma in view of a personalized onco-functional balance (balancing survival against the preservation of function). Previous research using machine-learning models found that predicting pre-operative cognitive functioning based on clinical variables resulted in accurate predictions for some, but inaccurate predictions for other patients. Therefore, the current study sets out to use Bayesian models to improve predictions while also providing estimates of uncertainty for each individual prediction. Pre-operative cognitive functioning was predicted for 340 patients with a glioma across eight cognitive tests. This was done using six increasingly complex Bayesian regression models including hierarchical models conditioned on tumor grade. Models used a comprehensive set of predictors associated with cognitive functioning in the literature. Point-wise predictions were compared against one another and previous work using machine learning. The best-performing model (R2) was interpreted and examples of how Bayesian prediction models can be applied in clinical practice were provided. Bayesian models outperformed the machine-learning models used in previous work. Predictions, however, remained uncertain. The best-performing model allowed coefficients and intercepts to differ across tumors with a different grade while pulling the estimates toward the population mean. Moreover, the best-performing model included regularizing priors, causing it to use most variables for prediction while not relying strongly on any variable. Bayesian models resulted in better predictions than machine learning models while also providing estimates of uncertainty for individual predictions. For the best possible predictions, tumors with a different grade are best modeled as different, yet related. Moreover, a holistic view of patients’ cognitive functioning is necessary. The uncertainty in individual predictions exemplifies the importance of measures of uncertainty for clinical practice.},

  abstract         = {The preference for simple explanations, known as the parsimony principle, has long guided the development of scientific theories, hypotheses, and models. Yet recent years have seen a number of successes in employing highly complex models for scientific inquiry (e.g., for 3D protein folding or climate forecasting). In this paper, we reexamine the parsimony principle in light of these scientific and technological advancements. We review recent developments, including the surprising benefits of modeling with more parameters than data, the increasing appreciation of the context-sensitivity of data and misspecification of scientific models, and the development of new modeling tools. By integrating these insights, we reassess the utility of parsimony as a proxy for desirable model traits, such as predictive accuracy, interpretability, effectiveness in guiding new research, and resource efficiency. We conclude that more complex models are sometimes essential for scientific progress, and discuss the ways in which parsimony and complexity can play complementary roles in scientific modeling practice.},
